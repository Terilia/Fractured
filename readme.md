Fractured 

A small hobby project to learn interaction between server and client via websockets. With the help of Node.js, Express.js and socketio. 
It was meant to be a fast hack, but turned into a full 1-3 hour long puzzle game with minor horror elements. 

Start with node app.js

Warning: As this was just a learning projec,t it doesn't follow the correct npm structure, be warned. Game code can be found in Fractured\node_modules\game
